- Created a functional blackjack game, utilizing basic algorithms and data structures in Python. This project was done before my MDS program, and it demonstrated my ability to quickly learn a new skill.

- The interface takes a userâ€™s input for how many chips they want to bet, and whether they want to hit or stand. I created the game to be like the casino, since Blackjack was what got me interested in Data Science in the first place.
